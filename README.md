Open Weather API 

## Description 

The Open Weather API homework is to provide current and updated weather conditions to users based on the cities they search for. It provides at a glance the city name, date, temperature, humidity and the UV index. It also provides forecast for the next 5 days which will come in useful if they need to know the weather conditions for travel planning etc. 

It also appends the list of recent cities searched, so that user can simply click on it to retrieve data instead of having to re-type to search.
